# Right Version for the Task

**Intent:** 

## Problem

During the software lifecycle, there may exist several distinct incarnations of
a software system. In general, they are identified by the version number and
release number. Usually you will have at least two different releases. There
will be a stable release, which is the one advertised for end user and is
indicated for production usage. In parallel, there will be a development
release, which is not ready yet for wide consumption, but where the development
of new features happens.

## Solution

Use the latest stable release for bug fixing activities. Use the development
version for the development of new features, and for everything else that is
not the correction of existing defects.
