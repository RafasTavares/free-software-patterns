# Separate Unrelated Changes

**Intent:** 

## Problem

TODO Sometimes you fix two unrelated bugs and commit them together. However, if you have to undo some of them, and they are unrelated, you will have to undo both, even if only one was necessary. Concerning refactoring, you may loose the path (small steps) of a refactoring if you only commit the new code after the execution of the last step.

## Solution

Propose unrelated changes by means of separate commits/patches.
