# Easy Tasks First

**Intent:** Start working on easy tasks that provide instant gratification and help you to overcome entry barriers.

## Motivation

Start contributing to a FLOSS project can be daunting, and 
prospective contributors may face challenges to entry into the FLOSS world.
You may be a novice programmer, that is used to develop small programs
by yourself.
Or it may be the case that you have some experience with 
traditional software development, where tasks are previously assigned
to developers, testers, and so on,
but not with self-assigned tasks in a community of  volunteers.
You may even have no programming knowledge at all, but still
want to contribute to a FLOSS project.
In any situation, it important that prospective contributors
manage to overcome entry barriers and 
keep interested in contributing.

## Problem

How can you start to contribute to a FLOSS project and yet keep interested?

## Forces

Many forces are involved when you are preparing yourself to make your first
contributions:

* _Analysis paralysis_. New contributors may be tempted to first understand
  everything and only then start to contribute. However, by the time a new
  contributor understands everything about a project -- even if that could be
  possible -- she might have already lost interest on it.
* _Shooting a moving target_. Software is continuously in process of change. If
  your contribution takes too long, it may be irrelevant by the time it is
  finished. For example, when you finish modifying a piece of code you realize
  that it has been replaced or removed in the latest version of the software.
* _Learning by doing_. Contributors can build their understanding of the system
  incrementally while they contribute.
* _Instant gratification_. Every contribution is important. When  successfully 
accomplished, you feel like you're adding value to the FLOSS project, 
even if it is something trivial. 

## Solution

Look for easy tasks that need to be performed and start working on them. 
You will probably complete them in a reasonable amount of time
and feel instant gratification.
Easy tasks include working on bugs that have trivial fixes, adjusting the style of 
the source code to match the project coding style, or other housekeeping tasks.

Suggestions for easy tasks can be found in different places, 
but it is desirable that you try
to find them by observing and interacting with the development ecosystem.
 
* First, you can [Look for TODO lists](link://involvement/LookForTodoLists) and try to find easy tasks to work with.

* Blogs, wikis and websites may also provide clues on easy tasks for newcomers to  start contributing.

* Mailing lists may be  used to announce or discuss issues about the development of the project. Easy tasks can be identified there if other contributors that join these lists are willing to help, by providing suggestions for newcomers.

* Finally, IRC channels can be used to be in contact with other contributors and developers and easy tasks can be identified.

## Trade-Offs

**Pros:** 

* Working on easy tasks allows a contributor to gain knowledge about the software and the community incrementally, and at the same, provide contributions to the project.  

* Dealing with easy tasks allows new contributors to focus on the process and not only on the tasks.

* Working on easy tasks provides instant gratification.

**Cons:** 

* The contributor might feel that the easy tasks are not important enough because nobody did them before. However, it is useful to consider that dealing with the hard stuff may leave no room for thinking about the easy ones; also, easy tasks can involve changes that have positive impacts on the project and on its users.

* Lists of easy tasks are not always actively maintained. If this is the case, you may find tasks that made sense in the past but are not applicable in the current state of the project. Be sure to signal your intent to solve a task to get updated information from developers. 

## Rationale

Humans are mostly short term and oriented towards instant gratification,
seeking for immediate results.
By performing manageable tasks in FLOSS projects, 
contributors can build their understanding of the system
incrementally while they contribute, and keep 
their interest and motivation to contribute.

Besides knowing the code, there is also a lot of other aspects of a free
software project that a developer can get used to by working first on "trivial"
tasks: 
getting used to the procedure for submitting contributions and having
them reviewed by more experienced project members, 
interacting with the project infrastructure (bug tracking systems, communication channels, etc) 
and others.
By the time the new contributor has acquired the expertise to work on 
more difficult tasks, the supporting infrastructure may not be an issue anymore.

## Known uses

When the [LibreOffice project](http://www.libreoffice.org/) started, the
initial team wanted to attract new contributors. They created an initiative
called [Easy Hacks](http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/Easy_Hacks),
that provides guidance for new contributors and lists of tasks considered easy
for newcomers to accomplish.

GNOME has a similar initiative called [GNOME
Love](https://live.gnome.org/GnomeLove), which is "the place to learn how to
start contributing to GNOME". Besides providing guidance on the topics
contributors need to learn, GNOME Love also includes marking bugs that should
be easy for new contributors to solve.

Noosfero has a list of tasks marked as [Easy to
Solve](http://noosfero.org/Development/EasyToSolve) where prospective
developers can find bite-sized bugs to fix or enhancements to make.

## Related Patterns

You might want to [Look for TODO Lists](link://involvement/LookForTodoLists)
that already contain tasks categorized by difficulty level.

In general, you are dealing with easy tasks when you

important parts of the documentation. 

## What Next

After selecting easy tasks to start with, you might want to look at some
\textit{Contribution patterns}. Having the [Right Version for the
Task](link://contribution/RightVersionForTheTask) is crucial, and make sure you
[Review Your Changes](link://contribution/ReviewYourChanges) before submitting
them.
