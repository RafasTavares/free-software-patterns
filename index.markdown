# Presentation

The process of contributing to [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)
(also known as "open source software") projects has special characteristics
that have fostered the emergence of many practices, each of
which influenced by various forces and entailing trade-offs.

In this book, we document such practices by means of patterns.  The Free
Software Patterns book is a open project, and you can
[contribute](link://contribute) to it.

The Free Software Patterns are organized around clusters. Each cluster of
patterns is presented as a simple pattern language, that is, a set of related
patterns that may be combined to address a common set of problems. Our three
clusters of patterns are:

* **Selection Patterns**, that help prospective contributors to find suitable
  projects.
* **Involvement Patterns**, that deal with the first steps towards getting
  familiar and involved with the selected project, and
* **Contribution Patterns**, that document best practices for submitting
  different kinds of contribution to a free software project.

The *Selection Patterns* and *Contribution Patterns* clusters are intrinsically
associated with the nature of free software projects, and represent novel work
by us.

Getting involved with a free software project, however, presents several
similarities with the process of getting involved with any software project,
such as investigating the existing documentation, building the system from its
sources, reading the code, etc. For that reason, the *Involvement Patterns*
cluster reuses several patterns from the excellent [Object-Oriented
Reengineering Patterns](http://scg.unibe.ch/download/oorp/), by Serge Demeyer,
St√©phane Ducasse and Oscar Nierstrasz, together with a few new patterns
proposed by us. In general, *Reengineering Patterns* is a recommended companion
to *Free Software Patterns*. We are grateful to Demeyer, Ducasse and Nierstrasz
for having [licensed](link://copyright) their work under a Creative Commons
license, allowing us to partially base our own work on theirs.
